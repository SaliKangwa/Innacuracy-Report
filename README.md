<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
This image illustrates the data capture process for stock deliveries that contain discrepancies but already have a Purchase Order (PO) raised in the ERP system. Once the PO Number and PO Suffix are entered, all related fields are auto-populated from the ERP system. This setup allows the requester to only input the Discrepancy Type and Reason, reducing manual data entry, minimizing human error, and ensuring data accuracy. <br/>
